## A Game for 4th Graders

<img class="ui medium left floated rounded image" src="../images/math.jpg">

As an end of term final project in my Computer Science class, my professor instructed us to create a program that deals with the mathematical operations. The idea of the project was to have the program calculate a number no matter how small or large the value was. So given the requirements, I decided to utlize the idea and create a math game for 4th graders. Through C++, I generated a menu-like display where students can select which operation they'd like to test themselves on (i.e. addition, subtration, multiplication, and division). And with each operation, a problem would appear in which the students can type out their answer, then see whether they got the correct answer as displayed on the menu. Given how the game was directly aimed for 4th graders, I wanted to limit the difficulty of the game with only having the value up to 100. So as the student continues with the game, values that ranges from 0 to 100 would be displayed as a mathematical problem they need to solve.      

## Reflection: I don't like C++
Working on this project was extremely difficult. It occured at the stage where I was just recently introduced with programming, so I was completely overwhelmed using C++. Although it may have been difficult, I've found the project that I've developed to be so useful. I brought my program amongsts kids that I knew and had them play the math game. They've found it to be challenging, but fun at the same time.
