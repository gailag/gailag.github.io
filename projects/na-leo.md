# Graphic Designing
During my employment as a graphic designer for UH Maui College's Literary Review, Na Leo, I had the chance to create a number of fun and exciting projects. The leniency that my employer provided at the time has allowed me to be as creative as I wanted. It was as if a blank canvas was handed to me, to which I'm told I can do whatever I want with it. During that time, I had an obsession with Adobe softwares, particularly in Illustrator and InDesign. I would even make a board on pinterest accumulating ideas and inspirations as to what my next design would look like. I had so much fun being a graphic designer that it didn't even feel like a job.

Here is some code that illustrates how we read values from the line sensors:

```js
byte ADCRead(byte ch)
{
    word value;
    ADC1SC1 = ch;
    while (ADC1SC1_COCO != 1)
    {   // wait until ADC conversion is completed   
    }
    return ADC1RL;  // lower 8-bit value out of 10-bit data from the ADC
}
```
