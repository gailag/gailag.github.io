## Graphic Designing
During my employment as a graphic designer for UH Maui College's Literary Review, Na Leo, I had the chance to create a number of fun and exciting projects. The leniency that my employer provided at the time has allowed me to be as creative as I wanted. It was as if a blank canvas was handed to me, to which I'm told I can do whatever I want with it. During that time, I had an obsession with Adobe softwares, particularly in Illustrator and InDesign. I would even make a board on pinterest accumulating ideas and inspirations as to what my next design would look like. I had so much fun being a graphic designer that it didn't even feel like a job.

## Event Flyers & Thumbnails

<img class="ui medium left floated rounded image" src="../images/naleoflyer.jpeg">

Flyers and posts thumbnails were things that I mostly created for Na Leo. One particular project that I really enjoyed creating was a flyer for an event that the Na Leo team hosted. The event consisted of showcasing an accumulation of the number of art submissions submitted by students since the beginning of the school year. Planning, marketing, and estimated budgeting was intricately thought out by the Na Leo team in order to make the event succesful as possible. I remember creating so many drafts with the event flyer, consisting of getting multiple adjustment requests from my team in order to make a great impression on whoever sees it. The image in this post is the final draft of the flyer that I end up creating. I create a 3D-like theme for the center piece with the intent of making it eye catching. Creating this flyer was so stresful given the amount of pressure and expectation that I was getting from my team. Ultimately though, I end up creating something that I am proud of up until to this day.

As excited as we were with the event, it was scheduled at the time where the whole world was faced with lockdown due to COVID. So we unfortunately didn't end up hosting the event. As saddening as it is, I do not regret the amount of work I've put into the event. I had so much fun working my role as a graphic designer, that ultimately led me into creating a flyer that I am really proud of.




Most of designs that I created can still be found at the [UHMC Na Leo Literary Review Website](http://maui.hawaii.edu/naleo/).
