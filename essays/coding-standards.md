## Programming

"When you're looking at a cup, which part do you think should be the cleanest?" is a question that my TA Branden recently shared with us related to coding standards. "No matter how great the physical aspects of a cup may be, it's more important to determine whether it's clean enough to drink." He compares this idea with web applications, that no matter how impressive and pretty a website might look like, it's rendered useless when it doesn't work the way it's supposed to. As a programmer, it's always a best practice to have a clean program in order to minimize the amount of errors. that may arise in the future.

## ESLint

ESLint is a static code analysis tool that detects error patterns in a JavaScript code.
