## RadGrad

RadGrad is an online platform that provides guidance for computer science students at UH Manoa in preparation for a career after college. Interests, careers, courses, and opportunities are presented on the website to deliver various types of information that can essentially help students identify what they would like to do in the future. Information related to your major are often overwhelming and difficult to find, and RadGrad delivers these information in an organized manner.

My experience as a transfer student at UH Manoa has been nothing but disorienting. I wasn't quite familiar with the new environment yet, so I was clueless with the type of opportunities available to me. I've been trying to expand my network to people with similar interests, and it's fortunate that RadGrad presents various types of clubs and organizations that I could join.
