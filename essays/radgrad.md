## RadGrad

RadGrad is an online platform that provides guidance for UHM computer science and computer engineering students in preparation for a career after college. Interests, careers, courses, and opportunities are presented on the website to deliver various types of information that can essentially help students identify what they would like to do in the future. Information related to your major are oftentimes overwhelming and difficult to find, and RadGrad delivers these information in an organized manner.

My experience as a transfer student at UH Manoa has been nothing but disorienting. I wasn't quite familiar with the new environment yet, so I was clueless with the type of opportunities available to me. I've been trying to expand my network to people with similar interests, and it's fortunate that RadGrad presents various types of clubs and organizations that I could join.

## Lots of Opportunities

Another great feature that I discovered through RadGrad was the number of internship and research opportunities that is available for CS majors. The number of businesses and organizations based in Hawaii was quite surprising. I didn't realize how expansive the tech industry in Hawaii is. Cloud Honolulu, Mind Hawaii, and Campus Analytics Challenge were few of the opportunities that I've found interest in. I was previously just using network platforms like LinkedIn to find internship opportunities nationwide, and RadGrad is an additional platform that I can use to discover opportunities that are specifically based in Hawaii.

## Growth in RadGrad

Although RadGrad is currently catered to computer science and computer engineering students, I can see a potential growth with the platform where it can cater to all majors. It is a great platform that provides a clear pathway that students can follow, and help them discover opportunities to build the skills needed for their future career.
