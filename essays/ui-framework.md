## Front-end Development

Front-end requires developing websites that are user-interactive and eye appealing. The use of Semantic UI allows software engineers to develop a more modern-like websites, hindering from a site looking like it was created in the 90s. A well designed website creates great impressions and a sense of credibility from site viewers, and Semantic UI provides that. Semantic UI reminds me of makeup -- you don't need it to look pretty, but it can make you look prettier.

Semantic UI is the first UI Framework I have used when designing a website. I was completely oblivious to its existence prior to my class's introduction. I thought modern existing websites were merely developed from raw HTML and CSS alone. I was completely amazed with the power of UI Frameworks.
