## Technical Questions

  Asking questions are always encouraged, no matter how ridiculous they may be. It always leads you to a newfound knowledge, expanding to even more questions that you want to know more about. There is no such thing as dumb questions -- it is only then perceived as dumb based on how the question was delivered. Eric Raymond's 'How to Ask Questions The Smart Way' exhibits why tailoring questions into a smart way are important and more effective in leading you to the solution you are looking for.  
  
  Before crafting the question, you have to ask yourself, "Has someone asked this question before?". Because in most cases, someone may have already asked the same question, to which you can easily acquire the information they have discovered. However, although it may be rare, you may stumble a situation where you can't find the solution, and begin to believe that no one has ever been in the same situation as you before. In such case, Eric suggests to carefully determine the right platform/forum in order to deliver the question to the right audience. When posting the question, Eric advises to avoid doing: 
  - posting a question to an off-topic forum
  - posting an 'elementary' question where an advanced questions are rather expected
  - cross-posting on multiple platforms
  - posting a personal email to someone who isn't personally obligated in solving the problem for you
