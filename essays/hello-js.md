## JavaScript

Printing out "Hello World!" has consisted through my programming in C++, Java, and Python. But quite recently, I have had the chance to finally learn JavaScript for the first time. I have heard from many that it is quite similar to the language Java, and after learning the basics, I can see the similarities. FreeCodeCamp has been a helpful environment in learning the basics of the language. I was dreading the fact that it consisted of 113 parts to complete, but I've found each of them so helpful in understanding what goes behind every test run. I was so nervous about my lack of skills in programming, and the sections that the site has provided was really helpful in building my knowledge.

The Workout of the Day (WOD) provided in my Software Engineering I class has been nothing but overwhelming to me. The purpose of the WOD itself is to asess us with how well we learned the module that was taught the week of, and how we can apply it to different problems. The time limit that the WOD has is what makes it overwhelmin. I am pressured to program a solution within a given time frame. It often takes me a while to think of the best way to approach a problem. As overwhelming as it can be  though, I can see how effective it is in terms of my growth as a programmer. Using such method can help me prepare for my technical interviews, as well as building skills as to what the tech industry expects in an candidate. For now, I hope my feeling of being overwhelemed diminishes the more I am exposed to these WOD. I can do it!
