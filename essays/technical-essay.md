## Becoming a SWE

<img class="ui medium middle floated rounded image" src="../images/swe.jpeg">

When I changed my major from Business to Computer Science four years ago, I wasn't sure if I was doing the right decision. I was questioning myself if I was smart enough to have the capability to develop programs. I was going through identity crisis at the time, and I thought changing my major to Computer Science was just a temporary placement for another major that I was going to change into. I thought it was going to be a phase, but here I am four years later still majored in Computer Science. What made me doubtful about this major initially was the fact that I didn't really know much about Computer Science. I wasn't fully aware in the capabilities of what a Computer Science degree can provide. Studying Computer Science is like walking into a playroom filled with lego blocks, and you can build whatever your heart desires. 

I have always had an interest with technology, with how they were invented as well as its functionality in serving humans. The growth of technology is exponentially increasing, and I'd like to be part of it in creating an efficient and better version than what was previously invented. Although I have not found a particular interest that I'd like to focus on, I've been recently interested in AIs and Virtual Environments. Artifical Intelligence and Virtual Environments are two of the emerging aspects in the growth of technology that us humans increasingly rely on, in which I'd like to develop such skills in the future.  

Given the exponential growth of technology, it is no surprise that everything is merging into online platforms now. There is a sudden popularity in the desire to work in the tech field, which is reassuring to me in a way that validates my question about whether I made the right decision in changing my major. There is an extreme shortage with the employment in the tech field, that the salaries to work as a software engineer was baffling to me. I've found it to be reassuring and motivating at the same time in helping me complete my degree. Becoming a software engineer with that amount of salary can provide me a sweet life that I've always desired.
